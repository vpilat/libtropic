# Tutorials
To quickly get you started on your host platform, we prepared tutorials.

We first recommend starting with our **TROPIC01 Model**.

## A. I want to play with the TROPIC01 Model
Using TROPIC01 Model is a great way of evaluating the Libtropic SDK on your computer and discovering amazing TROPIC01 functionality without a need of a physical chip!

## B. I want the real deal
If you have already experimented with our TROPIC01 Model and you are ready to try the TROPIC01 chip, go ahead!

Pick a tutorial based on your host platform and a development kit you want to use:
