# 4. Mac-And-Destroy Example
This example illustrates MAC-And-Destroy, the flagship feature of TROPIC01.

!!! success "Prerequisities"
    It is assumed that you have already completed the previous TROPIC01 Model tutorials. If not, start [here](../model/index.md).

You will learn about the following functions:

- `lt_mac_and_destroy()`: L3 command to process MAC-and-Destroy operation,
- `lt_r_mem_data_erase()`: L3 command to erase R-memory data slot,
- `lt_r_mem_data_write()`: L3 command to write R-memory data slot,
- `lt_r_mem_data_read()`: L3 command to read R-memory data slot,
- `lt_random_bytes()`: function to generate random number using platform's RNG (not TROPIC01's),

In this example, we also define two functions to implement PIN verification functionality:

- `lt_new_PIN_setup()`: setups the PIN,
- `lt_PIN_entry_check()`: checks the PIN.

You can use these functions as an inspiration for your project.

    For more information about Mac-And-Destroy, we recommend checking out the [Pin Verification Application Note](https://github.com/tropicsquare/tropic01?tab=readme-ov-file#application-notes) or the example's source code in `examples/model/mac_and_destroy/`.

## Build and Run
Before proceeding, make sure you have activated the virtual environment you installed the TROPIC01 Model in and started it. If you're lost, see [First Steps](first_steps.md).

Now, you can build and run the example (the example project is located at `examples/model/mac_and_destroy/`):
