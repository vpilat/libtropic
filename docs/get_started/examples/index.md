# Examples

!!! important "Check out [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) first!"

For each supported host platform, we have several examples available. Each example is a standalone project. Examples are available in the `examples/` directory, sorted by host platforms (and HALs).

There are always at least two basic examples for each platform:

- Hello World example,
- Firmware update example.

Those two examples are thoroughly documented in [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md). The tutorials will guide you on preparing your environment, compilation and running those examples.

For some platforms, we have also prepared some advanced examples, which are described in following pages in detail:

- :fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux
    - [Full chain verification example](linux/full_chain.md)
- :simple-stmicroelectronics: STM32
