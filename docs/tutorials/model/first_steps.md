# 1. Your First Steps with Libtropic

Hello and welcome to Libtropic SDK! In the first tutorial, we will compile our first example.

Before proceeding, make sure you have activated the virtual environment you installed the TROPIC01 Model in:

!!! example "Activating the virtual environment"
    === ":fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux"
        If the virtual environment is already activated, you will see "(.venv)" prefix in front of the prompt. For example:

        ```bash
        (.venv) me@computer:~/libtropic$
        ```

        If you don't see the "(.venv)" prefix, activate the environment:

        ```bash { .copy }
        source scripts/tropic01_model/.venv/bin/activate
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-apple: macOS"
        TBA

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"
        TBA

Some examples require a fresh start of the model. You can start and terminate the model as following:

!!! example "Using the model"
    === ":fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux"
        Open a new console (or a new tab in your console emulator). Make sure you have the virtual environment activated. Type:
        
        ```bash { .copy }
        model_server tcp -c scripts/tropic01_model/model_cfg.yml
        ``` 

        This will start a new TROPIC01 Model server. You can inspect the output after running examples if you are interested.
        Make sure you are running exactly one TROPIC01 Model server instance!
        
        To terminate the server, press ++ctrl+c++ in the console.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

## *Hello, World!* Example
At first, let's see the *Hello, World!* example:

!!! example "Building and running the example"
    === ":fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux"
        Go to the example's project directory:
        ```bash { .copy }
        cd examples/model/hello_world/
        ```
        Create a `build/` directory and switch to it:
        ```bash { .copy }
        mkdir build/
        cd build/
        ```
        And finally, build and run the example
        ```bash { .copy }
        cmake ..
        make
        ./libtropic_hello_world
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-apple: macOS"
        TBA

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"
        TBA

You should see an output similar to this:

```
======================================
==== TROPIC01 Hello World Example ====
======================================
PRNG initialized with seed=14758818
Initializing handle...OK
Sending reboot request...OK
Starting Secure Session with key slot 0...OK
Sending Ping command...
        --> Message sent to TROPIC01: 'This is Hello World message from TROPIC01!!'
        <-- Message received from TROPIC01: 'This is Hello World message from TROPIC01!!'
Aborting Secure Session...OK
Deinitializing handle...OK
```

If you see the output, congratulations! 🎉 You used Libtropic to send a *Ping* command with a message to the TROPIC01 Model!
