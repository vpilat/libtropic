# TROPIC01 USB Devkit Tutorials
These tutorials will help you get started with our TROPIC01 USB Devkit (available [here](https://www.tropicsquare.com/order-devkit)) mainly on Linux-based systems, but it should also be compatible with other POSIX systems. We will go through our examples in the `examples/linux/usb_devkit/` directory.

## Hardware Setup
As mentioned above, we will use our TROPIC01 USB Devkit (available [here](https://www.tropicsquare.com/order-devkit)), specifically the TS1303 version, but other versions should also work:

Go ahead and plug the USB Devkit into your machine.

## Software Setup
First, install the dependencies and prepare the repository:
!!! example "Installation Instructions"
    1. Install CMake:
        - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install cmake`
        - Fedora: `sudo dnf install cmake`
        - Other: [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/)
    2. Install GCC and Make via your distribution's package manager:
        - `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential`
    3. Get the Libtropic repository:
        - Using git: `git clone https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic.git`
        - Or you can [download latest release](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic/releases/latest).

After that, setup your system:
!!! example "System Setup Instructions"
    Make sure you have access to a USB UART interface. Usually, your user account has to be a member of a certain group, usually the `dialout` group:
    ```bash
    # Check if you are in the dialout group
    groups
    # If not, add yourself to the dialout group
    sudo usermod -aG dialout "$USER"
    # Log out and log in again to reflect changes.
    ```
