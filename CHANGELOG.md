# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- STM32 HAL: updated L432KC and started active support again.
- STM32 HAL: moved clock initialization out of the HALs to remove dependency on user's `main.h` and allow for higher flexibility.
  - Clock initialization is up to the user now and it is demonstrated in our integration examples.
- Logging: Changed handling of newlines. In the main code base, we now use line feed (LF, `\n`). Refer to your platform's documentation
  about if and how the LF is translated automatically (e.g., `stdio.h` implementation of major desktop platforms) or if you
  need to modify the behavior yourself (e.g., by modifiying `_write` syscall on STM32), or (in the case of the embedded platforms)
  you just need to configure your serial monitor correctly, so it expects only LF character (and not CR+LF pair).
- TCP HAL: Fixed `lt_port_init()` cleanup, refactored local functions.

### Added
- Logging: `lt_port_log` function for platform-specific logging mechanism; is used by the logging macros declared in `libtropic_logging.h`.
- CAL: `lt_sha256_deinit` function to deinitialize the SHA-256 context. It is called after the SHA-256 operation is finalized, so it must do an exhaustive cleanup.
- ESP-IDF HAL for Espressif SoCs.

### Fixed
- `lt_print_bytes` function now returns `LT_PARAM_ERR` when incorrect parameters are passed instead of `LT_FAIL`.
- `lt_print_fw_header` function now returns `LT_PARAM_ERR` when incorrect bank ID is used instead of `LT_FAIL`.

### Removed
- Logging: Redundant/unused macros `LT_LOG`, `LT_LOG_RESULT`, `LT_LOG_VALUE`.
- Arduino HAL: Removed `rng_seed` from `lt_dev_arduino_t`, as it should be user's responsibility to initialize the PRNG.
- Arduino HAL: Removed `SPI.begin()` and `SPI.end()` calls (fixes [this](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-arduino/issues/15) issue). It is now expected that users initialize SPI in their code themselves.

## [3.0.0]

### Changed
- Refactored crypto HAL.
- Refactored `trezor_crypto` HAL.
- Reworked handling of pairing keys:
  - All default pairing keys for slot 0 are now available from `libtropic_common.h`. As a result, a dependency on Python `cryptography` package was removed.
  - Keys for other slots (that are used by examples and tests) are defined only in examples/tests that need them.
  - `provisioning_data/` moved to `tropic01_model/`, as they are not needed anymore when not working with the model.
- `tropic01_model/`: don't compile unsupported examples.
- Moved crypto HAL code outside of `hal/crypto/` to `cal/` and started reffering to crypto HAL as CAL (Crypto Abstraction Layer).
- Refactored compilation of CALs and supported crypto libraries (details in the [Add to an Existing Project](https://tropicsquare.github.io/libtropic/latest/get_started/integrating_libtropic/how_to_build/adding_to_project/) section of the libtropic documentation):
  - Libtropic can be built as a static library without CALs or crypto libraries (replaced compile-time crypto type macros with runtime polymorphism using the `crypto_ctx` void pointer contained in `lt_l3_state_t`).
  - Crypto libraries are no longer in the `vendor/` directory (besides copy of `trezor_crypto/` for quick testing purposes). Providing the crypto library is now the consumer's responsibility.
  - CAL API was refactored to be compatible with the new `crypto_ctx` structure.
  - For testing purposes, quick switching of supported crypto libraries was implemented in the `tropic01_model/` CMake project.
- Moved contents of `hal/port/` into `hal/`.
- Moved TCP and USB dongle port into `hal/posix/`.
- Moved Linux SPI port into `hal/linux/`.
- Refactored platform HAL compilation.
- Renamed `lt_dev_stm32_nucleo_f439zi` to `lt_dev_stm32_nucleo_f439zi_t`.
- Added sections **Supported Host Platforms** and **Supported Cryptographic Functionality Providers** into **Other** section in the Libtropic documentation.
- Added dependencies on [micro-ecc](https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc) and [ed25519](https://github.com/orlp/ed25519/tree/master) repositories in functional tests (for verification of signatures calculated by TROPIC01).
- Updated L3 result values according to Application FW 1.1.0:
  - Renaming of `lt_ret_t` values:
    - `LT_L3_PAIRING_KEY_EMPTY` to `LT_L3_SLOT_EMPTY`.
    - `LT_L3_PAIRING_KEY_INVALID` to `LT_L3_SLOT_INVALID`.
    - `LT_L3_ECC_INVALID_KEY` to `LT_L3_INVALID_KEY`.
    - `LT_L3_R_MEM_DATA_WRITE_WRITE_FAIL` to `LT_L3_SLOT_NOT_EMPTY`.
    - `LT_L3_R_MEM_DATA_WRITE_SLOT_EXPIRED` to `LT_L3_SLOT_EXPIRED`.
    - `LT_L3_MCOUNTER_UPDATE_UPDATE_ERR` to `LT_L3_UPDATE_ERR`.
- Renamed `LT_L2_STATUS_NOT_RECOGNIZED` to `LT_L2_STATUS_UNKNOWN`.
- `lt_l3_decrypt_response()` returns `LT_L3_RESULT_UNKNOWN` instead of `LT_FAIL` if the L3 result value is unknown.
- Moved `LT_ASAN` CMake option from Libtropic's CMakeLists.txt to the model's CMakeLists.txt.
- Renamed `LT_STRICT_COMP_FLAGS` to `LT_STRICT_COMPILATION`, moved it from Libtropic's CMakeLists.txt to the model's CMakeLists.txt and set it ON by default.
- TCP HAL: removed `rng_seed` from `struct lt_dev_posix_tcp_t`. In the case of the TROPIC01 model, the PRNG is seeded in `tropic01_model/main.c`.
- Linux SPI HAL: remove `rng_seed` from `struct lt_dev_linux_spi_t` and use `getrandom()` in `lt_port_random_bytes()`.
- POSIX USB Dongle HAL: remove `rng_seed` from `struct lt_dev_posix_usb_dongle_t` and use `getentropy()` in `lt_port_random_bytes()`.
- STM32 F439ZI HAL: Removed the RNG initialization, now it is the user's responsibility.
- STM32 F439ZI HAL: Changed `rng_handle` type in `lt_dev_stm32_nucleo_f439zi_t` to a pointer (`RNG_HandleTypeDef*`).
- New return value `LT_REBOOT_UNSUCCESSFUL` returned by `lt_reboot` function, which now checks if TROPIC01 is in correct mode after the reboot.
- Examples: Refactored and cleaned up `lt_ex_show_chip_id_and_fwver` and `lt_ex_fw_update` logic to use the new version of the `lt_reboot` function.
- Meaning and names of `lt_tr01_mode_t` enum values. Now, this enum is supposed to be used with the new `lt_get_tr01_mode` function.
- CMake: Renamed `LT_CPU_FW_VERSION` to `LT_CPU_FW_UPDATE_DATA_VER` to make it more clear that it is used for the FW version to update to.

### Added
- Possibility to measure test coverage with the TROPIC01 model.
- Documentation: section **Default Pairing Keys for a Secure Channel Handshake** in Get Started
- GitHub action to run examples against TROPIC01 model (only the supported ones).
- Replaced `TR01_L3_RES_SIZE_SIZE` and `TR01_L3_CMD_SIZE_SIZE` with `TR01_L3_SIZE_SIZE`.
- Renamed `TR01_L3_CYPHERTEXT_MAX_SIZE` to `TR01_L3_CIPHERTEXT_MAX_SIZE`.
- Renamed `LT_L2_DATA_LEN_ERROR` to `LT_L2_RSP_LEN_ERROR`.
- New generic size macros: `TR01_L3_RESULT_SIZE`, `TR01_L3_CMD_CIPHERTEXT_MAX_SIZE`, `TR01_L3_RES_CIPHERTEXT_MAX_SIZE`.
- Size macros for L3 results.
- New return values (`lt_ret_t`): `LT_L3_RES_SIZE_ERROR`, `LT_L3_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`.
- L3 buffer size check  to `lt_init` and internal functions.
- Finished interrupt pin support:
  - In HALs that don't support it, raise compilation error.
  - Implement support in Unix SPI HAL.
- Support for MbedTLS v4 crypto backend.
- `enum lt_ret_t`:
  - `LT_L3_RESULT_UNKNOWN` for unknown L3 result values from TROPIC01.
  - `LT_L3_HARDWARE_FAIL` to reflect the new L3 result value from TROPIC01.
- HAL port for Arduino framework.
- `lt_get_tr01_mode` function to get current mode (`lt_tr01_mode_t`) of TROPIC01. This function is a replacement for `lt_update_mode`.

### Fixed
- `lt_ex_show_chip_id_and_fwver`: reboot back to Application mode in the end.
- Compilation if `LT_USE_INT_PIN` is set from CMake.
- TROPIC01 Model: apply ASan to libtropic if `LT_ASAN` is defined.

### Removed
- `TR01_L3_ID_SIZE` (redundant to `TR01_L3_CMD_ID_SIZE`).
- Functions `lt_ecc_ecdsa_sig_verify()` and `lt_ecc_eddsa_sig_verify()`.
  - Reason: They don't use any TROPIC01's functionality and are an unneccessary wrapper.
  - Consequences:
    - CAL was simplified, there are less requirements on CFP (ECDSA and EdDSA not required from now).
    - Libtropic's dependency on ed25519 was removed.
    - Signature verification was removed from the HW wallet example.
    - Users should verify the signatures themselves e.g., using functions provided by their crypto library.
- `lt_update_mode` function.
- `R_MEM_DATA_SIZE_MAX` macro because its value differs between Application FW versions. Use the appropriate [User API or datasheet](https://github.com/tropicsquare/tropic01?tab=readme-ov-file#datasheet-and-user-api) (based on the Application FW in use) as the source of truth for such constants.
## [2.0.1]

### Added
- Mentioned compatibility of libtropic 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 with FW 1.0.0 and Bootloader v2.0.1 in the main README.md compatibility table.
- Row in the compatibility table for libtropic 2.0.1.
- Section about TROPIC01 firmware in the documentation.

### Fixed
- Handling of `add` argument in the Mac-And-Destroy example (`lt_ex_macandd.c`): `NULL` can be passed, `memcpy()` will not be called with `NULL` argument and no additional data will be used in the M&D sequence.
- Set newest available FW version in CMakeLists.txt.
- CMakeLists.txt: use `set()` for string options, enhance validating of their values

- Model project: ability to run tests with AddressSanitizer or Valgrind with `LT_ASAN` or `LT_VALGRIND`.
- Support for `RESP_DISABLED` value of STATUS field in L2 frame.

### Fixed
- Assigned value to `LT_L1_CHIP_BUSY` and `LT_L1_INT_TIMEOUT` in `lt_ret_t`, incremented all values starting from `LT_L3_R_MEM_DATA_WRITE_WRITE_FAIL`.
- Added missing `LT_L1_INT_TIMEOUT` in `lt_ret_strs`.
- Fixed nonce overflow vulnerability in lt_l3_nonce_increase, the function now returns `LT_NONCE_OVERFLOW` if the nonce cannot be increased anymore.
- Calculation of number of chunks in the function `lt_l2_send_encrypted_cmd()`.
- Chip id parsing in `tests/model_based_project/create_model_cfg.py`.
- Function `lt_r_mem_data_read` -  change `size` to output parameter and its handling.
- Set value of macro `L3_CMD_DATA_SIZE_MAX` to 4111.
- Added 13 of maximal padding to macro `L3_FRAME_MAX_SIZE`.
- Set value of macro `PING_LEN_MAX` to 4096.
- Allowed mcounter index 0 in libtropic API (`lt_mcounter_init`).
- Bug in `lt_random_value_get` which caused stack smashing.

### Removed
- Macro `LT_USE_ASSERT`, `assert()` is always inserted.
- Functions `get_conf_addr()`, `get_conf_desc()`, accessing the configuration table directly is advised instead.
- Removed `keylen` parameter from `lt_ecc_key_read()` and `lt_in__ecc_key_read()`.
- Removed `rs_len` parameter from `lt_ecc_eddsa_sign()` and `lt_ecc_ecdsa_sign()`.
- Removed macro `LT_L3_EDDSA_SIGN_CMD_MSG_LEN_MIN`.
- Header file `include/TROPIC01_configuration_objects.h`.
- Checks with `<` for enums (fixes compilation errors on STM32 and shouldn't be needed anyway).
- File `tests/model_based_project/compile_tests.sh` (refer to `tropic01_model/README.md` for instructions about compiling tests).
- File `tests/model_based_project/model_logging_cfg.py`.
- WiringPi port (`lt_port_raspberrypi_wiringpi.c`), was replaced with Generic Linux SPI port (`lt_port_unix_spi.c`).
- Parameter `max_len` from functions `lt_get_info_riscv_fw_ver()` and `lt_get_info_spect_fw_ver()`.
- Attribute `__attribute__((aligned(4)))` for `struct header_boot_v2_t`.

## [0.1.0]

### Changed

- `ECC_SLOT1-32` numbering changed to `ECC_SLOT_0-31`.
- `lt_handshake()` function renamed to `lt_session_start()`.
- Unit tests and platform tests organization was updated.
- Included `lt_l2_api_structs.h` and `lt_l3_api_structs.h` are automatically generated.
- `SH0` pairing keypair in `keys/keys.c` now reflects engineering samples of TROPIC01 devices.
- Changed logging format in examples.
- Renamed cmake switches: `LT_USE_TREZOR_CRYPTO`, LT_BUILD_DOCS.
- Platform examples are removed - now they are standalone repositories.
- Separated libtropic API calls introduced (session_start and ECC_ECDSA functions):
  - lt_l3.* contain interfaces for encoding l3 data going out and decoding l3 data going in,
  - libtropic.* then wraps l3 functions and does the whole l3 exchange in one round,
  - this change allows user to send data through a tunnel between host and target MCU,
    which then behaves as a relay.
- Separated l2 API calls introduced:
  - Now user can use separate function for sending and receiving data.
- Refactoring of `lt_handle_t` struct:
  - contains separate structs for l2 and l3,
  - allows to split all l2 and l3 calls into separate actions.
- Option to define l3 buffer introduced (`LT_SEPARATE_L3_BUFF`).
- Introduced a new folder `keys/` where user might specify SH0-SH3 keys.
- Remove `lt_serial_code_get()`.
- Rename `LT_L2_STARTUP_ID_MAINTENANCE` to `LT_MODE_MAINTENANCE`.
- Rename `LT_L2_STARTUP_ID_REBOOT` to `LT_MODE_APP`.
- Code formatted with `clang-format` version 16 is now enforced on push to branch.
- Add `LT_PRINT_SPI_DATA` - used to debug print low level communication.
- Moved logging and assert macros to `libtropic_logging.h` (they were defined twice in
files `libtropic_examples.h`, `libtropic_functional_tests.h`).
- Instead of using `LT_ADD_FUNC_TESTS` and `LT_BUILD_TESTS`, use only `LT_BUILD_TESTS`.
- Rename `LT_ADD_EXAMPLES` to `LT_BUILD_EXAMPLES` to be consistent with `LT_BUILD_TESTS`
  and `LT_BUILD_DOCS`.
- Always increment host's nonce in `lt_l3_decrypt_response()`.
- When `LT_BUILD_EXAMPLES` or `LT_BUILD_TESTS` are set, CMake requires to define `LT_SH0_PRIV_PATH`.
- Removed SH0 keys and pkey_index_{0,1,2,3} from `keys/keys.c` and reflected it in examples, tests.
- Added writing of pairing keys to slots 1,2,3 in `lt_test_ping` and created `lt_test_engineering_sample_01_ping` from the old version of `lt_test_ping`.
- Set default value to `LT_SH0_PRIV_PATH`.

### Added

- L3 commands: MCounter (init, update and get), MAC-and-destroy.
- L2 commands: Resend, Sleep and Log req.
- libtropic API: lt_update_mode().
- Example folder and test folder is reworked.
- Option LT_ADD_EXAMPLES controls if example's folder code is a part of compilation.
- Option LT_ADD_FUNC_TESTS controls if code from tests/functional/ folder will be compiled-in.
- Port/ support and tests/platform/ example for Raspberry Pi.
- Added macro `LT_USE_ASSERT`, based on which `assert()` is inserted into `LT_ASSERT` and `LT_ASSERT_COND`.
- Added CTest handling for functional tests.
- Added `SESSION_OFF` for indicating that secure session is off and assigned it to `lt_l3_state_t.session` flag in `lt_init()`.
- Added function `lt_l3_invalidate_host_session_data()`, which sets all data in `lt_l3_state_t` to zero and `session` to `SESSION_OFF`; it is called in `lt_session_abort` and when ciphering/deciphering of L3 command fails (wrong TAG).
- Added CMake variable `LT_SH0_PRIV_PATH`, based on which `sh0_keys.c` is generated for examples or tests, so sh0priv and sh0pub are defined.
- Added CTest handling for functional tests run against TROPIC01 model.

### Fixed

- Return values for L3 API
